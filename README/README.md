README GENERATORRRRRRR!!!!!

Hey Guys!

I just realize I have to make a description of the project!

Well this is a backend application to generate a readme using inquirer

We used npm install inquirer, because we needed their sweet modules.

We have mainly 2 js files which do all the work for us.

The first one is the index file.

The index file gets the inquirer modules and then ask the user some questions and the inits the code, which also writes it to the markdown file.

The Markdown file gets the information from the index.js and puts it with links to the sections.

There is a readme sample, on the main folder.
